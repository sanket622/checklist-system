Adding New Conditions to the API Logic
If you need to add new conditions in the future, follow these steps:

Understand the Data Structure: Familiarize yourself with the API's JSON structure. The key-value pairs and nested objects/arrays in the payload determine the logic for new conditions.

Identify the Condition: Decide the logic for your new condition:

Is it a validation condition?
Does it involve transformation or modification of the data?
Will it influence the decision flow in your application?
Modify the Code: Add your new condition to the appropriate part of the logic. Below are common scenarios:

Validation Logic: Ensure that the incoming data meets the criteria (e.g., isActive must be true).
Business Logic: Add specific rules (e.g., if loanRequired exceeds a certain amount, apply a risk rating).
Example Implementation: Suppose you want to add a condition to ensure isUkResident is true before processing. Update the logic like this:

javascript
if (!apiData.isUkResident) {
    throw new Error("The applicant must be a UK resident.");
}
Update Comments: Always document your changes with meaningful comments. For example:

javascript
// New condition: Ensure that the applicant is a UK resident.
if (!apiData.isUkResident) {
    throw new Error("The applicant must be a UK resident.");
}
Testing:

Write test cases to verify the new condition.
Test edge cases to ensure robustness.
Deploy and Monitor: After implementing the new condition:

Deploy the updated logic.
Monitor for unexpected behavior or errors in production.
Inline Code Comments Example
Below is a snippet with comments for adding a new condition:

javascript
// Validate that the applicant is active before proceeding
if (!apiData.isActive) {
    throw new Error("The application is not active. Cannot process further.");
}

// New condition: Ensure that the applicant is a UK resident
// This check prevents non-UK residents from being processed
if (!apiData.isUkResident) {
    throw new Error("The applicant must be a UK resident.");
}

// Future condition placeholder
// Add additional checks here if needed
// Example:
// if (!apiData.isValuationFeePaid) {
//     throw new Error("The valuation fee must be paid before proceeding.");
// }
